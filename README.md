</div>

A VS Code theme designed with a balanced color palette to be easy on the eyes and provide functional syntax highlighting.

Also includes support for italics on reserved keywords and function names.

- [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/): A font with support for italics that costs around \$40
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/): A new free open source font from Jetbrains with nice ligatures

This was my first shot at making one so I will continue to update and tweak it as needed.
